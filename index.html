    <h1>TOPSNight 2013 Leadership</h1>
    <p>A few things before you vote: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Vote for your top three choices. If you leave any blank, your vote will be discarded.</li>
      <li>Vote for people you think are responsible and can lead us and make this work; don't just vote for your friends.</li>
      <li>You cannot change your vote after you cast it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Names must be typed exactly: capitalize the first letter of their first name, and include their last initial. If there are two people with the same first name and last initial, also include their middle initial. Do not use punctuation. Examples: <pre>
Eric Y
Eric C Y
      </pre>(But don't actually vote for me :P)</p>
